HTML-GIT-CSS

This repository describes the nature of the homework for week 1 covering HTML-GIT-CSS.

The assignment went over Web Content Accessibility Standards (WCAG) that websites should meet. Websites should be created in an accessible way for those with alternative needs, such as a Screen Reader.

In the index.html, all &lt;div&gt; elements were changed to match the Accessibility Standards including, but not limited to, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;

Alt tags were added to various images and ARIA labels were added to elements; both providing alternative text for items (such as images that do not load.

Additionally, changes were made to some CSS to avoid redundancy and for a cleaner UI.
