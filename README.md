## User Story
```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
## Usage

In the index.html, all &lt;div&gt; elements were changed to match the Accessibility Standards including, but not limited to, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;

Alt tags were added to various images and ARIA labels were added to elements; both providing alternative text for items (such as images that do not load.

Added accessibility for older IE browser versions.

Additionally, changes were made to some CSS to avoid redundancy and for a cleaner UI.

Wasn't able to get the hero image to be a proper hero image.
