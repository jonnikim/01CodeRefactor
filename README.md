HTML-GIT-CSS

This repository describes the nature of the homework for week 1 covering HTML-GIT-CSS.

The assignment went over Accessibility Standards that websites should meet. I used https://teachaccess.github.io/tutorial/ and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML as primary sources of information. All <div> elements were changed to match the Accessibility Standards including, but not limited to, <header>, <main>, <aside>, <footer>
